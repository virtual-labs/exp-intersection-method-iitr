Step-1) Click on the main file and wait until home screen appears.<br><br>
Step-2) There are three buttons in this experiment i.e. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Button, PLANE TABLE ACCESSORIES Button, OBSERVATION & PLOTTING Button.<br><br>
Step-3) BACKGROUND INFORMATION Button: This button is used to give all the background information regarding the experiment.<br><br>
Step-4) PLANE TABLE ACCESSORIES Button: This button is used to give all the accessories used in the experiment.<br><br>
Step-5) OBSERVATION & PLOTTING Button: This button will navigate us to the main simulation page.<br><br>
Step-6) There are five objects (flag, pole, house, windmill and tree) placed in the field. Initially plane table is located at position A.<br><br>
Step-7) On the left side of the pane, alidade view of objects is also given to see the clear view of the objects.<br><br>
Step-8) Click on the object and we will get a telescopic view through alidade and the line is drawn parallel to the line joining the intersection of the cross hairs and the object and the length is determined by actually scaling off the distance between them. <br><br>
Step-9) Click on <b>Next Buttton</b> after taking all five observations to move to the position B.<br><br>
Step-10) Repeat the Step 8 at B.<br><br>
Step-11)After taking all the observations click on <b>Result Button </b> as shown below.<br><br>
Step-12) Observations are displayed in the graphical form.<br><br>
